<h2>About this Version</h2>

<p>
The major difference brought by this version (1.2) is the addition of
a pruned SSA (Static Single Assignement) form for the IRs
(Intermediate Representations: JBir and A3Bir). This version also adds
features regarding IRs (easy way to access and navigate in code,
efficient data structure, (optional) generation of check instructions
for linking operations, etc.) and fixes some minor bugs in IRs
transformation and HTML output. See details of these changes and other
minor changes in the CHANGELOG file.
