<h2>About this Version</h2>

<p>
  The major difference brought by this version (1.4) is the Formula feature. It
  allows to use special functions in the code source in order to make various
  assertions and checks which might not be inferred by an analysis. You can have
  a look in the tutorial for an example. An important work of reorganisation
  has also been realized, making easier to use (and for us, to maintain) the
  different available representations (Bir, A3Bir, SSA variants...). It has
  conducted to some bug fixes and documentation improvements. It should
  also be notice that the licence of Sawja is now GPL and no more LGPL. You can
  obtain the detail of the changes in the CHANGELOG file.
