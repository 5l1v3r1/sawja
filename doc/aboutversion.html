<h2>About this Version</h2>

This version (1.1.1) fixes some important bugs in RRTA and XTA, and
some minor bugs detailled in CHANGELOG file.

The major difference brought by version 1.1 is the addition of a
module which allows to inline not nested subroutines, the modification
of BIR code representation (represented as an array) and the addition
of a new call graph computation algorithm (XTA). Moreover JVMTI has been
added and allows to trace native methods actions in an execution, this
information could be used for call graph computation algorithms. Others minor changes are detailled in the CHANGELOG file.
