<h2>About this Version</h2>

<p>
The major difference brought by this version (1.3) is an Eclipse
  plugin for Sawja analyzes (see Eclipse plugin webpage): it allows
  developers to add an analysis in Eclipse just by adding an
  executable. The new modules ArgPlugin and JPrintPlugin were added
  and provide the interfaces to build a compatible executable for the
  plugin (see Sawja tutorial webpage). This version also adds some
  utility functions and documentation on fixpoint solvers included in
  Sawja (Iter and Sage). It also fixes some minor bugs. See details of
  these changes and other minor changes in the CHANGELOG file.
