<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
  <em>Sawja</em> is a library written in <em>OCaml</em>, relying on
  the <em >Javalib</em> to provide a high level representation
  of <em>Java</em> byte-code programs. Whereas <em>Javalib</em> is
  dedicated to class per class loading, <em>Sawja</em> introduces
  a notion of program thanks to control flow algorithms.
</p>

<p>Moreover, <em>Sawja</em> provides some stack-less intermediate
  representations of code, called <em>JBir</em> and <em>A3Bir</em>.
  The transformation algorithm, common to these representations, has
  been formalized and proved <sup>1</sup>.
