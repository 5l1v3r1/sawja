From 1.0.1 to 
-------------
Compilation & Installation changes:
* installation process now rely on ocamlfind (more homogeneous installation,
  easier to use as dependencies are automatically linked in)
* add a configure script into the compilation routine that automatically generate the appropriate Makefile.config file. Local installation is now an easy option.
?* add shared option for compilation (.cmxs) ?

New features:
* add a module JsrInline that allow to inline major part of subroutines (do not include nested subroutines).
* bir code representation is now flatten and represented as an array, in consequence correpondance tables between bytecode and bir representation are added.
* add XTA algorithm that allow to refine a call graph with various sensitivity (see documentation)
* add a module Safe that supply a fixpoint iterator specialized for domains on code (Global, InterfaceOrClass, Field, Method, PP).
* ?? include jvmti that could be use to add static information on native method during program discovery (RTA, CRA).

Minor changes:
* IR changes: 
  - add a ~ir_ssa and ~bcv flag for transform function !!!doc!!!
  - add Cast unary operator
  - new exception_hanlder type , a specific catch var is created for each handler
  - add printing functions (string and for JPrintHTML)
  - all var are now indexed, remove equal_var function (use = instead)
* RTA changes:
  - add classes to instanciate by force and abstract entrypoints in RTA
  - add load of classes: catch type of handlers and fields of loaded classes (even if not accessed)
* add static_lookup_special function in JControlFlow (for invokespecial instruction)
* module JPrintHTML is now generic with respect to the implementation of methods
* documentation of sawja now includes the documentation of the
  user-interface of javalib (javalib, jBasics and jCode)
* improve documentation and tutorial

Minor fixes:
* fixes some CSS bugs
* bugfix on arrayload types of ir representations
* correct handling of local variable names (debug option) in JPrintHTML.

Known bug:
* Program discovery does not include native methods and reflection
* XTA and RRTA are both buggy (is it JControlFlow ?, in this case RTA is buggy too...).
* Corresp PP in IR ...

From 1.0 to 1.0.1
----------------
Minor fixes:
* typos in documentation / tutorial / quick start
* better error handling in JPrintHtml
* providing style.css which was missing (looks better in JPrintHtml)
* installation procedure should run more smoothly

Initial release 1.0
--------------------
This initial version features a fork from Javalib 1.8.1 where the code
concerning the program representation and manipulation has been moved from
Javalib to SAWJA.  From Javalib 1.8.1, The main improvements includes the
bytecode transformations, the overall efficiency (more lazy stuff, indexed data,
caches, etc.) and the cleanner interfaces and documentation.

Main features:
* Program representation where the bytecode (method) representation can be
  modified
* Intermediate bytecode representation (bytecode with expressions and without
  stack and 3 addresses code)
* Control flow manipulation (resolution of classes, fields and methods, static
  over approximation of lookups, etc.)
* Program discovery with RTA (Rapid Type Analysis), CRA (Class Reachability
  Analysis) and RRTA (Refine Rapid Type Analysis)
* Stub generation for object allocation for native methods from concrete
  execution
* Program pretty printing as text or HTML output
