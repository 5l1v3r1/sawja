From 1.0.1 to 1.1
-----------------

Compilation & Installation changes:
* installation process now rely on ocamlfind (more homogeneous installation,
  easier to use as dependencies are automatically linked in)
* add a configure script into the compilation routine that automatically
  generate the appropriate Makefile.config file. Local installation is now an
  easy option.
* compilation of a dynamically loadable library (.cmxs) is now proposed

New features:
* add JsrInline, a module which allows to in-line most subroutines (all but
  nested ones).
* BIR code representation is now flatten and represented as an array.
  Correspondence tables between bytecode (JCode) and BIR have been added.
* add a call graph computation algorithm with different level of sensitivity
  (ranging from MTA to XTA) (see documentation in XTA)
* add a module Safe, a static analysis framework, which provides a fixpoint
  iterator, domain composition, standard containers for method, fields, class
  and program points, etc.
* ?? include JVMTI that could be use to add static information on native method
  during program discovery (RTA, CRA).

Minor changes:
* IR changes: 
  - add a ~ir_ssa and ~bcv flag for transform function !!!doc!!!
  - new exception_handler type, a specific catch var is created for each handler
  - add printing functions (string and for JPrintHTML)
  - all var are now indexed
  - structural equality (=) can be used on var (equal_var function removed)
* RTA changes:
  - add a set of default instantiated classes and abstract entry points
  - more classes are now loaded: catch type of handlers and field types of
    loaded classes are loaded (even if not accessed)
* add static_lookup_special function in JControlFlow (for invokespecial
  instruction)
* module JPrintHTML is now generic with respect to the implementation of methods
* the documentation of Sawja now includes the documentation of the
  user-interface of Javalib for cross-references (Javalib, JBasics and JCode)
* improve documentation and tutorial

Bug fixes:
* fixes some CSS bugs
* bugfix on arrayload types of BIR representations
* correct handling of local variable names (debug option) in JPrintHTML.
* CheckArthimetic was missing in jBir
* a Cast unary operator was missing in jBir

Known bug:
* Program discovery does not include native methods and reflection
* Inconsistencies between results of XTA, RTA, RRTA and CRA.  XTA and RRTA are
  probably buggy but it could also be the case of CRA and RTA (specially if
  JControlFlow is implicated).
* Correspondence between program point of JCode and Bir

From 1.0 to 1.0.1
----------------
Minor fixes:
* typos in documentation / tutorial / quick start
* better error handling in JPrintHtml
* providing style.css which was missing (looks better in JPrintHtml)
* installation procedure should run more smoothly

Initial release 1.0
--------------------
This initial version features a fork from Javalib 1.8.1 where the code
concerning the program representation and manipulation has been moved from
Javalib to SAWJA.  From Javalib 1.8.1, The main improvements includes the
bytecode transformations, the overall efficiency (more lazy stuff, indexed data,
caches, etc.) and the cleanner interfaces and documentation.

Main features:
* Program representation where the bytecode (method) representation can be
  modified
* Intermediate bytecode representation (bytecode with expressions and without
  stack and 3 addresses code)
* Control flow manipulation (resolution of classes, fields and methods, static
  over approximation of lookups, etc.)
* Program discovery with RTA (Rapid Type Analysis), CRA (Class Reachability
  Analysis) and RRTA (Refine Rapid Type Analysis)
* Stub generation for object allocation for native methods from concrete
  execution
* Program pretty printing as text or HTML output
