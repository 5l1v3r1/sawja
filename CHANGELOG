From 1.0.1 to 
-------------
---
New features:
* installation process now rely on ocamlfind (more homogeneous installation,
  easier to use as dependencies are automatically linked in)
* documentation of sawja now includes the documentation of the
  user-interface of javalib (javalib, jBasics and jCode)
* add a module JsrInline that allow to inline major part of subroutines (do not include nested subroutines).
* bir code representation is now flatten and represented as an array, in consequence correpondance tables between bytecode and bir representation are added.
* add XTA algorithm for program discovery (see doc)
* add a module Safe that supply a fixpoint iterator specialized for domains on code (Global, InterfaceOrClass, Field, Method, PP).

* ?? include jvmti that could be use to add static information on native method ?

Minor changes:
* New version of JPrintHTML, more generic 
* add printing function for ir representation
* add static_lookup_special function in JControlFlow (invokespecial instr)
* improve documentation and tutorial
* add a ~ir_ssa and ~bcv flag in ir transforms !!!doc!!!
* add Cast unary operator in ir representations
* new exception_hanlder type for ir representations, a specific catch var is created for each handler
* all var in ir representations are now indexed, remove equal_var function in ir representations, use = instead
* add load of catch types classes and all fields classes in a class (even if not accessed) in RTA
* add classes to instanciate by force and abstract entrypoints in RTA
* adding DELETE_ON_ERROR target for files generated with
  redirections in Makefiles (.depend and some others), moving from -dtypes to -annot in Makefile.config
* Add a configure script for Sawja
Based on the configure.sh script used for Javalib. Modifications have
been made to the Makefiles, and Makefile.config.example, to take into
account the configure-defined variables.

Minor fixes:
* fixes some CSS bugs
* Correct handling of local variable names (debug option) in JPrintHTML.
* updating JBir HTML output 
* Bugfix on arrayload types of ir representations

Known bug:
* XTA and RRTA are both buggy (is it JControlFlow ?, in this case RTA is buggy too...).
* Corresp PP in bir ...

From 1.0 to 1.0.1
----------------
Minor fixes:
* typos in documentation / tutorial / quick start
* better error handling in JPrintHtml
* providing style.css which was missing (looks better in JPrintHtml)
* installation procedure should run more smoothly

Initial release 1.0
--------------------
This initial version features a fork from Javalib 1.8.1 where the code
concerning the program representation and manipulation has been moved from
Javalib to SAWJA.  From Javalib 1.8.1, The main improvements includes the
bytecode transformations, the overall efficiency (more lazy stuff, indexed data,
caches, etc.) and the cleanner interfaces and documentation.

Main features:
* Program representation where the bytecode (method) representation can be
  modified
* Intermediate bytecode representation (bytecode with expressions and without
  stack and 3 addresses code)
* Control flow manipulation (resolution of classes, fields and methods, static
  over approximation of lookups, etc.)
* Program discovery with RTA (Rapid Type Analysis), CRA (Class Reachability
  Analysis) and RRTA (Refine Rapid Type Analysis)
* Stub generation for object allocation for native methods from concrete
  execution
* Program pretty printing as text or HTML output
