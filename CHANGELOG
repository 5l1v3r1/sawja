Initial release 1.0Î²
--------------------
This initial version features a fork from Javalib 1.8.1 where the code
concerning the program representation and manipulation has been moved from
Javalib to SAWJA.  From Javalib 1.8.1, The main improvements includes the
bytecode transformations, the overall efficiency (more lazy stuff, indexed data,
caches, etc.) and the cleanner interfaces and documentation.

Main features:
* Program representation where the bytecode (method) representation can be
  modified
* Intermediate bytecode representation (bytecode with expressions and without
  stack and 3 addresses code)
* Control flow manipulation (resolution of classes, fields and methods, static
  over approximation of lookups, etc.)
* Program discovery with RTA (Rapid Type Analysis), CRA (Class Reachability
  Analysis) and RRTA (Refine Rapid Type Analysis)
* Stub generation for object allocation for native methods from concrete
  execution
* Program pretty printing as text or HTML output
